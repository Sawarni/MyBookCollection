# MyBookCollection
I am fond of books but very bad in keeping them. More than often I buy book, read it and like it but safely store it and forget about where I stored it safely. 
So I am creating this small project where I can see all my possessions and also where I have kept it.

# Techincal Details
Curently I am learning Blazor and hence I want to create this project to provide me a learning experience on how to deal with real world problems with blazor.
The middleware will be created in .Net Core web api and the database will use sql server.
